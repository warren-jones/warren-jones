I grew up in Northern California (East Bay Area), studied Music at North Texas State University (now renamed University of North Texas), switched to Computer Science.  Met my wife there.  Started grad school but took a full-time job with an early Speech Recognition research company.  Detoured into Aerospace software for a few years (hush-hush government contracts) until I was asked to develop a Windows app: That changed my course again, pointing me towards Microsoft.  I have developed a wide variety of Windows apps since then, with an occasional side-trip into the Linux world.  At Microsoft as a “v-” from 1995 to 1997 and 2016 through February 2023, with a few breaks.

I like to play with vintage vehicles: Cars, Tractors, and Snow-cats

I especially like to spend time with my Family: My wife, three “adult” children, and seven grandchildren
